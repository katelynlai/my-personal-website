                <p>Hello! I'm Katelyn - I am a final-year Computer Science undergraduate student, set to graduate in July. Over the past two summers, I’ve interned at One Stop’s head office as a Technology Intern, where I contributed to the development of their scanning software - a tool now deployed across stores throughout the UK.</p>
                <p>For my final-year dissertation, I built a web application that automates the assignment of supervisors and moderators to students, using JavaScript, React, and Firebase to streamline the process and improve efficiency.</p>
                <p>I particularly enjoy working on projects that have a meaningful impact and real-life applications, which inspire me to create solutions that genuinely help others. This drive for practical, purpose-driven work is reflected in my choice of dissertation project, where I focused on addressing real-world challenges to make a positive difference.</p>
                <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy baking and sports. I used to be a competitive swimmer but have now taken up running and am currently training for the Great South Run in October, where I’ll be raising money for the British Heart Foundation - a cause close to my heart.</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio! Feel free to connect with me on GitHub or LinkedIn!</p>

            <p>
                EcoTrackr is a carbon emission monitoring application that allows users to log their travel journeys - whether by car, train, or bus - and automatically calculates the carbon footprint of each journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app encourages sustainable travel by introducing a competitive element: users are ranked on a leaderboard based on how low their emissions are. The lower a user's carbon output, the higher their rank, promoting environmentally friendly choices through gamification.

            <h3>Final Year Project Management App</h3>
            <img src="image/fyp-app.png" alt="Diagram showing allocation process for final year project system" class="project-image" />
            <p>
                This web application was created for university administrators to automate the allocation of supervisors and moderators to student projects. 
                The image above outlines the key steps in the allocation process:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Filter out staff who have already reached their allocation quota.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Compare each student’s course or project topic to staff interests using keyword matching.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Apply a scoring system to rank potential staff matches.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If multiple staff qualify equally, prioritise those with the fewest current allocations.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Finalise assignments and save results to Firestore.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Built using React, JavaScript, and Firebase, the system simplifies the administrative workload while ensuring fair and interest-based allocation.
